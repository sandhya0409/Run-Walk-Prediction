# Run-Walk-Prediction
This project employs deep learning techniques to classify whether an individual is running or walking based on accelerometer data from iOS devices. Leveraging a dataset containing over 88,589 sensor readings, I conducted extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and optimize model performance.
